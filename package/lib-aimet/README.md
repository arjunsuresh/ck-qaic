# AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET)

<a href="https://quic.github.io/aimet-pages/index.html">AIMET</a> is a library that provides advanced model quantization 
and compression techniques for trained neural network models.
It provides features that have been proven to improve run-time performance of deep learning neural network models with 
lower compute and memory requirements and minimal impact to task accuracy. 

* This CK package installs a CPU variant of AIMET
